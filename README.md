CS596 Multiplayer Game Project

I had originally started on a first person shooter multiplayer, but I think it was a little too much for me in the given timeframe. So I pushed that to the side and started over, with a much simpler idea.
I wasn't sure exactly how much of the project folder I had to upload, so I uploaded the Assets folder (with all the scripts, prefabs, important stuff) as well as the built executable. I'll try to add the rest, but I'm not sure how much data can be uploaded for free.

Tank Tango is very simple, one player chooses to be the host and one player chooses to be the client.
Once connected, the goal is to shoot the other player's (red) tank.

Known issues:
- Sometimes, after a tank is destroyed, the killing bullet remains until naturally despawned.
- Collisions are funky.
