CS596 Multiplayer Game Project

I had originally started on a first person shooter multiplayer, but I think it was a little too much for me in the given timeframe. So I pushed that to the side and started over, with a much simpler idea.

Tank Tango is very simple, one player chooses to be the host and one player chooses to be the client.
Once connected, the goal is to shoot the other player's (red) tank.

Known issues:
- Sometimes, after a tank is destroyed, the killing bullet remains until naturally despawned.
- Collisions are funky.
